# Overlook

A project during my second module at Turing School of Software Design. The software is a hotel management tool for hotel staff to manage activities like customer details, booking details for different types of rooms, unbooking rooms, and calculating/showing a customerâ€™s total bill. Goals of this project are:

* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Separate business-logic code from view-related code
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Setup

### Clone Down and Run Locally

Fork and clone down repo.

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

Project is running at http://localhost:8080/

Go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to view your code running in the browser.
